# GithubDashboard

## User stories: 
1. As a user, I can view the dashboard page which has links to the search page and history so that I can
navigate around the app.
2. As a user, I can use the search page to search for GitHub users so that I can see their public profile.
3. As a user, I can view the history page which has a list of my past searches so that I can see the
successful and unsuccessful searches I've done.
4. As a user, I can view a user's public profile from the search results or history page so I can see more
information about the user.
5. As a user, I can clear a past search so that it doesnâ€™t clutter my history.
